                        <hr>
                        <p>In today’s world the customer demand is changing each day. It is very difficult to come up with new products now and then. Prototyping in all industries is very expensive and time consuming except in the software industry. To reduce this, it is necessary to come up with an economically viable alternative for developing new products rapidly and continually.<br><br>The current demand to reduce the time and cost involved in taking a product from conceptualization to production has forced companies to turn to new and emerging technologies in the area of new product development. One such technology is virtual reality (VR). Virtual reality allows a user to step through the computer screen into a three-dimensional (3D) world. The user can look at, move around, and interact with these worlds as if they were real. The primary concept behind VR is that of illusion. Virtual Prototyping (VP) is application of VR to simulate physical prototypes using product and process data, trying to emulate all characteristics of the physical prototype relevant to the application area as closely as possible (Zachmann, 2010). VR is used in various sectors like Architecture, Entertainment, Education & Training, Art, Medicine etc. VR is in initial stage of its use in India and especially in new product development.<br><br>This research is to study the viability of VR and its application in Indian manufacturing sector. In this research 3 products of sub industries are targeted. The products are Thresher from agricultural industry, Air conditioner (AC) from the home appliances industry and Parts manufactured using CNC from industrial product (parts) industry are studied. To do the research, questionnaire is used as instrument as research is exploratory. The questionnaire has been filled by 90 respondents from various groups like product designers, engineers and manufacturers. The approach to the study was administering a questionnaire to product designers, engineers and manufacturers of AC, thresher and parts manufactured using CNC machine via telephone, mail and face to face meeting.<br><br>Conclusion that can be drawn is virtual reality has good potential in Indian manufacturing sector. Virtual reality tool can be used for error identification and is also a reliable tool. The use of virtual reality can lead for a better understanding of process and mechanism for the engineers, help in designing to designer and manufacturers will be benefited as the process can be developed virtually. Virtual reality can lead to reduction in number of engineers, product designers and market analysts. The testing under difficult condition can be done quickly and economically. Product designers feel that usability can be tested. The important conclusion is that reduction in time and cost can be attained by use of virtual reality.<br>

                        <hr>
                        <p>The invention relates to a threshing machine, in particular a threshing machine to be used in the production of rice.<br><br>Threshing machines are machines designed to separate individual grains husks and stalks. The basic concept shared by threshing machines used for threshing rice is to insert the unmilled rice (known as rice paddy) into a machine having a spinning drum which has protrusions on its outer surface and a concave disposed around a substantial part of the drum. The concave is also arranged to have protrusions, or is made of a structure of parallel bars. When the machine is operating, the drum spinning in the concave pulls the material through the machine, and the grains pass between the protrusions on the drum and the concave, which separates the grains from the stalks by the contact of the drum and concave on the rice panicles. The clearance between the concave and the drum must be set correctly for the specific grain type being used, so as not to damage, crush, or split the grains.<br><br>The protrusions on the drum may take the form of radial pegteeth, rasp bars or wire loops. Each of these elements has its own advantages and disadvantages, notably the problems encountered with wet straw, which often clogs the concave element of the threshing machine. Wire loops, while they damage the grain less than pegteeth or rasp bars, degrade much faster and therefore require more frequent maintenance.<br><br>Currently, tangential flow threshers pass the crop tangentially between the drum and the concave, and require a system of sieves to separate the grains from the chaff after threshing. The rice paddy is fed from the front of the thresher, either by hand or by conveyor.This method of threshing is known to be damaging to the grains, especially in the case of basmati rice.<br><br>The International Rice Research Institute manufactures an axial flow thresher, in which the whole crop moves around the drum periphery due to the spinning of the drum in the concave, with a pegtooth threshing element arrangement. this performs well with wet crop and does not require straw separators, but has a higher power requirement than many threshers. The power requirements of this type of thresher can be too large for some small-scale agricultural practices.<br><br>These threshing devices all use a drum and concave arrangement in which the drum has an axis horizontal to the ground. A low power, convenient method of threshing rice which improves on the efficiency currently achieved by standard mechanised threshers, which does not significantly damage grains which are passed through it, and that can take wet crop is required.<br>
